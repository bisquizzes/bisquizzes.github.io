## 📖 **About the Project**

BisQuizzes is a versatile and interactive quiz platform designed for learners of any subject. With an intuitive interface, dynamic question filtering, and an immersive exam mode, it offers a seamless experience for practice and assessment.

Originally tailored for web development concepts, the platform can be easily adapted for other topics by simply swapping the question database (`questions_webdev_midterm.json`) and updating the title on the main page. The design prioritizes simplicity, responsiveness, and user engagement, making it suitable for learners of all levels.

This platform was created as part of a college project to showcase skills in web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON. It demonstrates the application of dynamic data management, responsive design, and interactive user interfaces.
